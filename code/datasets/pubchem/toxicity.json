It includes the likely routes of exposure (inhalation, ingestion, skin and eye contact), and the delayed, immediate, or chronic effects/symptoms from short- and long-term exposure, and the numerical measures of toxicity [e.g., acute toxicity estimates such as the LD50 (median lethal dose, the estimated amount of a chemical expected to kill 50% of test animals in a single dose)].  This section also includes information on whether the chemical is considered as a potential carcinogen according to authoritative sources such as the National Toxicology Program (NTP) Report on Carcinogens and the International agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs.",
